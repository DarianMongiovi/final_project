This dashboard is pretty straight forward as it shows the rates of death in the USA based on different causes for visualizations. The database is a csv file made available publicly through data.gov, and a few of the original columns were deleted to make the data more manageable. There are three static visualizations to show some general data that I think is relevant in this country. The first is a bar graph depicting the difference between overall death rates, and physical accidents. This gives us an indication of general safety as it shows the spread between accidents, and natural causes (disease). The next two graphs are static line graphs that show two major causes related to overall health, those being heart disease and diabetes. This is relevant as these conditions are considered manageable and can show trends in the general health of the population. The forth graph is an interactive line graph that gives the user the ability to pick from states, and the unique causes of death in the original data base. Two functions were written (bar_graph_filter, and heart_disease_diabetes_filter) to further filter the data. These functions were not necessary, but helped me to organize the data as decided what I wanted to analyze and display from the database. I also thought this helped clean up the html for the graphs as they weren't filled with confusing pandas data queries. There are a few use cases for this dashboard I can think of ranging from curiosity, the idea of safety trends that I mentioned earlier. To be honest this database was picked as I am more comfortable with csv files than SQL or other data formats. This also seemed like a manageable database so I could focus on learning about Dash and less about analysis.
